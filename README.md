![](img/banner.png)

As you can see, i'm creating projects that i made by myself. I know my project kinda useless but at least it's working. I use github to learn how git works, and all the repos that i posted here it's just me trying to make something that is useful for people in the future.

I still learning programming language though, like learning C#, Python, Java, and Pawn. Maybe in the future i can be a person who can make useful app, but who knows right?

O btw, glad to see you here ðŸ˜„

## What can i do?
* I can do C# basic
* I can do Python, but not that good. Just understanding basic stuff
* I can do Pawn, yes this is my main programming language for now
* I can do basic Java, idk why it seems simillar to Pawn ngl

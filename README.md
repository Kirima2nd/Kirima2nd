# About Me
Hello, i'm Kirima from Indonesia 🇮🇩

Just some NPC guy with bad twist and i love to just doing nothing at all. I do teach people how to make things (mainly Pawn) but only covered using Bahasa, not english since i have difficulties speaking with.

Speaking of difficulties, i'm also love open source software, this is why i tried to make some software that is available for people to use even if it seems to be useless tbh but who knows maybe there is someone will using it 😁

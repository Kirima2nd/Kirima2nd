# Hi, i'm Kirima2nd 👋
![](img/banner.png)

As you can see, i'm creating projects that i made by myself. I know my project kinda useless but at least it's working. I use github to learn how git works, and all the repos that i posted here it's just me trying to make something that is useful for people in the future.

I still learning programming language though, like learning C#, Python, Java, and Pawn. Maybe in the future i can be a person who can make useful app, but who knows right?

Oh, glad to see you here 😄

## What can i do?
* ♟️ Pawn (SA-MP/open.mp)

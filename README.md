# Hi, i'm Kirima2nd 👋
![](img/banner.png)

As you can see, i'm creating projects that i made by myself. I know my project kinda useless but at least it's working. I use github to learn how git works, and all the repos that i posted here it's just me trying to make something that is useful for people in the future.

I still learning programming language though, like learning C#, Python, Java, and Pawn. Maybe in the future i can be a person who can make useful app, but who knows right?

Oh, glad to see you here 😄

## What can i do?

I can write some of programming languages here:
* ♟️ Pawn (SA-MP/open.mp)
* 🐍 Python
* 💻 C#
* 💻 C++, Java, ad golang (only understand the basics)
* :computer: Brainfuck

And also, can do tutoring with bahasa, mainly focused on pawn scripting language
